# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

    # React Hooks - Normal JS function
    // Most important 2 hooks 
    // useState() - superpowerful local state variable in react
    // useEffect() - 

    # React Core Concept ->
    // React uses Reconciliation Algorithm also known as React Fiber (came in React 16)
    // Virtual DOM is representation of Actual DOM
    // Virtul DOM is React Elements (JS object) -> console.log(<Component />) will give you React Element which is normal JS object.
    // Diff Algorithm -> finds out difference between updated virtual DOM and previous virtual DOM -> this will actually update the actual DOM on every render cycle.

    //Example ->
    // If there are 15 restaurants which are loaded at start of the component and when user clicks on Top Rated filter button the restaurant data changes to (continues nexct line)
    // 7 then a new object is created with this new data. The diff algorithm finds the difference between new 7 resturant object with old 15 resturant object and then updates the actual DOM


    # useState core concepts
    - useState variables are declared like const [name, setName] - useState("akshay");
    - here akshay is default value for name.
    - we are doing array destructing as useState will return an array where first arguement is variable and second arguement is a function to update that variable.
    - whenever this variable changes react will rerender the component checking the changes using diff algorithm where it checks for different in old react object and the new one.

    # useEffect core concepts
    - If no dependency array => useEffect is called on every component render 
    - If dependency array is empty = [] => useEffect is called on initial component render(only once)  
    - If dependency array is [isLoggedIn] => useEffect is called everytime isLoggedIn is updated
    useEffect(() => {
        console.log("useEffect called");
    }, []);
    - To clean up things once component is removed from dom. Like for example cleaning up setTimeout() or setInterval()
    we do something like =>
    useEffect(() => {
        const timer = setInterval(() => {
            console.log("react is op")
        }, 1000);
        //clear timer here in this return function of useEffect
        return () => {
            clearTimeout(timer);
        }
    });


    # 2 types of routing in web apps
    - Client side routing
    - Server side routing - we get the html content from server. we send the request to server and fecth the html content.


    # Class based component refer -> User.jsx file and Contact.jsx file
    - React Lifecycle is explained in Contact.jsx file.
    - How parent and child component lifecycle is triggered and how react behaves behind the scenes.

    # Custom Hooks
    - They should not be defined as an async function.
    - Refer => RestaurantMenu.jsx and useRestaurantMenu.js files
